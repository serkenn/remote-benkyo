**A research-grounded tutor that defers to you, not to its training data.**

A Claude Code plugin and Python CLI that turn Claude into a tutor with persistent memory — tracking, per project, which concepts you want to truly understand and which you've decided to just use as a tool. Each operational rule cites the cognitive science it's built on.

**Status**: β. CLI in English, skills in Japanese.

> **Terminology.** A *project* in benkyo is a **learning unit** — one subject (e.g., Laplace transforms) bundled with the goal problems that anchor it and the per-concept treatment decisions for that subject. The cardinal-vocabulary rule in the skills (see `.claude/skills/`) translates this to natural Japanese (e.g., 「計画」) so the learner never sees the internal term.

## Get started

### 1. Install the CLI and the skills

```bash
# Python CLI
uv tool install benkyo            # or: pipx install benkyo

# Claude Code skills (5-skill bundle)
/plugin marketplace add youseiushida/benkyo
/plugin install benkyo
```

Restart Claude Code. Confirm `benkyo --version` works and the 5 skills appear in `/help`.

### 2. Hand your materials to Claude Code (or Codex CLI, or any agentic CLI)

Drop your study materials — past exams, the textbook PDF, the syllabus, lecture notes — into the directory you launch Claude Code from. Then just describe what you want:

```
You: I have the past 5 years of finals for ECE 220 (signals & systems), the
     textbook PDF, and the syllabus. The exam is in 12 days. Help me prep.
```

`benkyo-project-init` reads the materials, extracts the concept set and dependencies from how the textbook structures them, turns past-exam problems into the project's goal problems, proposes which concepts to treat as "use the formula" vs "really understand," asks you to confirm, and hands off to `benkyo-tutoring` for the first activity.

This works for any STEM domain where the curriculum is structured and past problems exist: classical mechanics, organic chemistry, algorithms, statistics, fluid dynamics, ML theory, and so on.

#### See the map (at any point)

Before you commit time, or whenever you want to step back during a session, ask Claude:

```
You: Show me the map.        /  全体見せて
You: What does the plan look like?
You: Where am I in this?
```

Claude will render the current concept graph via `benkyo render --format mermaid` — problems as stadium shapes, "really understand" concepts as rectangles, "use as a tool" concepts as cylinders. Mermaid renders inline on GitHub, in Claude Code's chat, and in any markdown-aware viewer.

You can also drive it yourself:

```bash
benkyo render --project prj1 --format mermaid > graph.md
benkyo render --project prj1 --format dot | dot -Tpng > graph.png
```

This is how you verify Claude actually understood your materials — and how you keep the bird's-eye view of what you've decided to learn vs what you've decided to just use.

### 3. Just keep talking

The 5 skills auto-trigger from what you say or what you do. You never type `benkyo` yourself; Claude does it on your behalf.

- "I don't get this" → `benkyo-tutoring` drops into a one-level breakdown of the concept, then climbs back up
- "I want to really understand X" → `benkyo-treatment-shift` commits the concept, makes sure the prerequisites exist as nodes, and switches to Problem-Solving-then-Instruction mode
- "Just give me the formula" → `benkyo-treatment-shift` releases it back to procedural with a reference table
- "Add convolution to the graph" → `benkyo-graph-edit` runs an identity check, then adds the node and edges
- "I'm done for today" → `benkyo-session-wrap` recaps, captures a delayed JOL, and atomically persists the session so next time picks up cleanly

## Concept

Two pieces that depend on each other:

1. **`benkyo` CLI** — a small Python tool (Click + SQLite + platformdirs) that owns a global concept-dependency graph plus, per project, the procedural/conceptual treatment of each concept, the goal problems, an append-only events log (delayed JOL, hypercorrection, treatment changes, session boundaries), and free-text project metadata.
2. **5 Claude Code skills** — operational playbooks under `.claude/skills/` that tell Claude when and how to drive the CLI on the learner's behalf. The learner converses naturally; Claude translates intents into CLI ops and applies decision rules drawn from published meta-analyses.

The learner never types `benkyo` themselves.

## Why

Naive LLM tutors fail in characteristic ways that the educational psychology literature has named and measured:

- They trust the learner's "got it" too quickly (foresight bias / hindsight bias; Bjork, Dunlosky & Kornell, 2013).
- They jump to explanation instead of letting the learner attempt first (loses generation effect d ≈ 0.40; Bertsch et al., 2007), and they jump to instruction before problem-solving (loses Productive Failure for conceptual knowledge: g = 0.36, 95% CI [0.20, 0.51]; Sinha & Kapur, 2021).
- They keep scaffolding when the learner has become fluent (expertise reversal; Kalyuga, 2007).
- They lose track of which concepts the learner actually said they remembered between sessions (no delayed JOL; Rhodes & Tauber, 2011, report a large meta-analytic advantage of delayed over immediate JOL gamma-correlation accuracy, Hedges's g = 0.93 across 112 effect sizes).
- They frame practice as a test, halving its effect (Bertsch et al., 2007: incidental d = 0.65 vs intentional d = 0.32).
- They miss the strongest teaching moments: high-confidence wrong answers (hypercorrection; Butterfield & Metcalfe, 2001).

benkyo addresses these by making the *structural* parts persistent (the CLI) and the *behavioral* parts explicit (the skills, with literature pointers next to each rule). The tutor's job is then to follow the skills, not improvise.

## Skill bundle

| Skill | Triggers on | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `benkyo-project-init` | "○○を勉強したい" / "I want to study X", new subject, materials shared, post-long-gap resume | Extracts goal, drafts initial graph, sets the initial procedural/conceptual cut |
| `benkyo-tutoring` | Mid-session activity ("分からない" / "I don't get it", "教えて" / "explain", "次" / "next", "分かった" / "got it") | The default in-session behavior: PS-I vs I-PS mode choice, breakdown protocol, self-eval handling |
| `benkyo-treatment-shift` | "ちゃんと理解したい" / "I want to really understand" (commit), "公式で OK" / "just memorize the formula" (release), or detected fatigue / transfer-failure signals | Changes a concept's depth-of-engagement; ensures prereqs exist before committing |
| `benkyo-graph-edit` | "これも追加" / "add this too", "これ別物" / "this is different", or a concept the learner mentions that isn't in the graph yet | Adds nodes/edges with an identity check; granularity decisions |
| `benkyo-session-wrap` | "終わり" / "I'm done", "また明日" / "let's continue tomorrow", abrupt interruption | Recap, delayed JOL seed, atomic persistence via `benkyo session end` |

Each `SKILL.md` references a shared library at `.claude/skills/_benkyo-shared/references/` for decision tables, the natural-language ↔ internal-vocab map, and literature pointers. (Files prefixed with `_` are not loaded as skills by Claude Code, so the bundle stays clean.)

## Architecture

```
Learner (natural language)
        ↓ ↑
Claude Code  ← skill auto-trigger by description
        ↓ ↑
    SKILL.md  → references/ (decision tables, nl-to-cli map, lit pointers)
        ↓
   benkyo CLI (read/write)
        ↓
   SQLite DB
```

Domain model in the DB (simplified):

- `concept_nodes` (`c1`, `c2`, …) — global, shared across projects
- `problem_nodes` (`p1`, `p2`, …) — also global
- `edges` — `prereq` or `related`, between nodes
- `projects` (`prj1`, …) — owns goal problems, treatments, free-text metadata
- `project_concepts` — per-project treatment (`procedural` / `conceptual` / unset → default conceptual)
- `events` (`e1`, …) — append-only log of state changes (`session_start`, `session_end`, `delayed_jol_recorded`, `hypercorrection_detected`, `treatment_changed`, `concept_probed`) with a free-text `notes` column for context that doesn't fit a payload schema

The "window" of a project is computed by BFS from goal problems via prereq edges; concepts marked procedural terminate traversal (they bound the depth the tutor needs to teach).

The full CLI surface is documented at `.claude/skills/_benkyo-shared/references/cli-cheatsheet.md` — or just run `benkyo --help` / `benkyo schema`.

## Research foundation

Each operational rule in the skills is backed by a published effect. The table below summarises; the literature pointer file (`.claude/skills/_benkyo-shared/references/literature-pointers.md`) gives the per-decision mapping.

| Operational rule | Primary source |
|---|---|
| Default PS-I for conceptual concepts; default I-PS for procedural | Sinha & Kapur (2021) |
| Build instruction on the learner's own attempt, not on the canonical solution | Sinha & Kapur (2021): PS-I with instruction-building g = 0.56 vs without g = 0.20 (subgroup p = .02) |
| Reduce scaffolding as the learner becomes fluent | Kalyuga (2007), expertise reversal |
| Rapid first-step diagnostic instead of long pre-tests | Kalyuga (2007), correlations up to r = 0.92 with full tests |
| Solicit a delayed JOL at session end; verify at next session start | Rhodes & Tauber (2011), Hedges's g = 0.93 for delayed-over-immediate gamma correlations |
| Brief anticipation before showing a worked example | Bjork et al. (2013); Kornell et al. (2009) |
| Frame probes incidentally — never say "test" | Bertsch et al. (2007), d = 0.65 vs 0.32 |
| Interleave related concepts within a session, not across days | Brunmair & Richter (2019) |
| Explicit contrasting correction for high-confidence wrong answers | Butterfield & Metcalfe (2001), hypercorrection |
| 1–6 day retention interval for probe scheduling | Adesope et al. (2017), g = 0.82 peak |
| Match probe format to intended use (TAP) | Adesope et al. (2017), g = 0.63 vs 0.53 |
| Treat learner self-evaluation as low-trust evidence | Bjork et al. (2013), 3 biases |

## Limitations

- **No probabilistic learner model**: benkyo deliberately stops at "events are queryable." It does **not** compute `P(mastered)` (BKT) or schedule reviews by a forgetting model (FSRS). Skills query the events log with simple heuristics. If you want a model, build it as a separate layer on top of the events log — that's the right boundary.
- **Self-managed scheduling**: spacing recommendations come from session-wrap and project-init heuristics, not from a per-card forgetting model. The 1–6 day Adesope window is a hint to the learner, not a queue.
- **Japanese-first skills**: the SKILL.md files and decision tables are currently written in Japanese (the primary user language). The CLI itself is English. Translation contributions welcome.
- **Two-layer brittleness**: if the CLI changes its surface and the skill's cheat-sheet isn't updated, the skill's `benkyo` invocations will fail. Run the test suite + the skill evals together on changes. `benkyo schema` lets skills introspect the live CLI shape.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest                       # 179 tests
benkyo --help
benkyo schema                       # JSON tree of the full CLI surface
```

Skill files live at `.claude/skills/benkyo-*/SKILL.md`. Each skill has `evals/evals.json` (3 single-turn scenarios) and `evals/trigger-eval.json` (16 trigger discrimination cases) — see `_benkyo-shared/evals/TRIGGER-OPTIMIZATION.md` if you want to run `example-skills:skill-creator`'s `run_loop.py` against them.
